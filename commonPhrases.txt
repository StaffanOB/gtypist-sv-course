How is it going? 
Long time no see! 
What have you been up to? 
Can’t complain 
How do you know? 
That’s a good one = that’s a good joke! 
Its very kind of you! 
Thank you anyway 
Thank you in advance! 
No worries 
What’s going on? 
Did I get you right? 
Don’t take it to heart 
I didn’t catch the last word 
Sorry, I wasn’t listening 
It doesn’t matter 
Fingers crossed! 
Oh, that. That explains it. 
Things happen 
Sorry to bother you 
I’ll be with you in a minute 
Where were we? 
I’m sorry, I didn’t catch you 
Lucky you! 
I freaked out = to become very angry, scared or excited
Good for you! 
You’ve got to be kidding me! 
Cheer up! 
Come on, you can do it! 
Keep up the good work! 
It's not the end of the world 
That’s lit! = That’s amazing! 
There you go! 
44. Not a bit! 
There is no room for doubt 
I’ll text you! 
it’s not worth it! 
You rock! 
You should go the extra mile… 
Step up your game = Start performing better 
Pull yourself together = Calm down and behave normally 
You sold me! = You convinced me on something 
Couldn’t care less = used to express total lack of interest in something 
This is a no
You screwed up 
You are driving me nuts! 
Can you cover me? = Can you work in my place? 
I’d better be going 
Thank heavens it’s Friday 
Take care!
